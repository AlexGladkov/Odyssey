**Odyssey**

Odyssey it's a declarative multiplatform navigation library for Multiplatform Compose

ðŸš§ WARNING! It's an early preview, so you use it with your own responsibility

### How to start

First add dependency to gradle

```kotlin
named("commonMain") {
    dependencies {
        implementation("...") // For core classes
        implementation("...") // For compose extensions
    }
}
```

### Main idea

#### Setup

The main class in library is `RootController` It provides navigation control and host
backstack inside. 

For setup navigation graph in common code you need to use

```kotlin
@Composable
fun RootContainer(
    rootController: RootController
) {
    RootHost(startScreen = NavigationTree.Root.Start, rootController = rootController) {
        destination(screen = NavigationTree.Root.Start) {
            // Here is the place to draw something in Compose
            // ...
            // Or you can provide composable function like below
            SomeScreen(rootController) 
        }
    }
}
```

#### Parameters

Params included inside destination by design

```kotlin
destination(screen = NavigationTree.Root.Start) {
    val key = params as? String
    SomeScreen(rootController, params)
}
```

#### Navigation

You must pass RootController to screen for inner navigation and if you need to open next screen
just use this

```kotlin
 rootController.launch(NavigationTree.Root.Container)
```

or this if you want to pass params

```kotlin
 rootController.launch(NavigationTree.Root.Container, params = "Your any object")
```

#### Back

If you need to go back just use. Library supports multibackstack navigation for any of platform

```kotlin
 rootController.popBackStack()
```

### Android Setup

For Android we must support hardware back pressing, so you need to do this in your Single Activity

```kotlin
  val rootController = RootController()
  rootController.setupWithActivity(this)
```
