**Odyssey**

Odyssey it's a declarative multiplatform navigation library for Multiplatform Compose

ðŸš§ WARNING! It's an early preview, so you use it with your own responsibility

### How to start

First add dependency to gradle

```kotlin
named("commonMain") {
    dependencies {
        implementation("io.github.alexgladkov:odyssey-core:0.0.1") // For core classes
        implementation("io.github.alexgladkov:odyssey-compose:0.0.1") // For compose extensions
    }
}
```

#### Setup

[1. Common preparations](documentation/COMMON.md)

[2. How to start with Android](documentation/ANDROID.md)

[3. How to start with Desktop](documentation/DESKTOP.md)

[4. How to start with iOS](documentation/IOS.md)

#### Parameters

If you need to add params to your navigation just use params parameter in launch function

```kotlin
rootController.launch(screen = "screen_name", params = paramState.value)
```

To catch this value you can use **backStackObserver**

```kotlin
// Compose example
val navigation = rootController.backStackObserver.observeAsState()
val params = (navigation.value?.destination as? DestinationScreen)?.params
```

```swift
// iOS Example
let observer = rootController.backStackObserver.watch { navigation in
    let params = (navigation.value?.destination as? DestinationScreen)?.params
}

// Don't forget to destroy observer
observer.close()
```

#### Navigation

You must pass RootController to screen for inner navigation and if you need to open next screen
just use this. You can use String as key for screen

```kotlin
 rootController.launch("splash")
```

You can use specific flags to make navigation as you want. Now we have only one flag.
```LaunchFlag.SingleNewTask``` to clear backstack if you need to start new screen from scratch

```kotlin
 rootController.launch(screen = "splash", launchFlag = LaunchFlag.SingleNewTask)
```

#### Back

If you need to go back just use. Library supports multibackstack navigation for any of platform

```kotlin
 rootController.popBackStack()
```
