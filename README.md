**Odyssey**

Odyssey it's a declarative multiplatform navigation library for Multiplatform Compose

ðŸš§ WARNING! It's an early preview, so you use it with your own responsibility

### Getting Started

First add dependency to gradle

```kotlin
named("commonMain") {
    dependencies {
        implementation("io.github.alexgladkov:odyssey-core:0.3.2") // For core classes
        implementation("io.github.alexgladkov:odyssey-compose:0.3.2") // For compose extensions
    }
}
```

### Start
This library contains two basic entities for work - RootController and NavigationGraph.

RootController needs to make navigation and works like single action

NavigationGraph describes your destinations and connections between them

To create navigation graph just create this extension

```kotlin 
fun RootComposeBuilder.generateGraph() {}
```

Then you can add screens inside this navigation graph and connect it to platforms. For now you can use 
this types of navigation

[1. Simple Screen](documentation/SIMPLE_SCREEN.md)
[2. Flow](documentation/FLOW_SCREEn.md)
[3. Bottom Navigation](documentation/BOTTOM_NAVIGATION.md)
[4. Bottom Sheet Navigation](documentation/BOTTOM_SHEET.md)

#### Navigation
[1. How to connect Android](documentation/ANDROID.md)
[2. How to connect Desktop](documentation/DESKTOP.md)
[3. How to connect iOS](documentation/IOS.md)

[4. Animations](documentation/ANIMATIONS.md)

#### Parameters

If you need to add params to your navigation just use params parameter in launch function

```kotlin
rootController.launch(screen = "screen_name", params = paramState.value)
```

#### Navigation

You must pass RootController to screen for inner navigation and if you need to open next screen
just use this. You can use String as key for screen

```kotlin
 rootController.launch("splash")
```

You can use specific flags to make navigation as you want. Now we have only one flag.
```LaunchFlag.SingleNewTask``` to clear backstack if you need to start new screen from scratch

```kotlin
 rootController.launch(screen = "splash", launchFlag = LaunchFlag.SingleNewTask)
```

#### Back

If you need to go back just use. Library supports multibackstack navigation for any of platform

```kotlin
 rootController.popBackStack()
```
